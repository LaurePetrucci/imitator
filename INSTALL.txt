                        Installing IMITATOR
                        ===================


Note: In case of problem, please read this INSTALL file carefully before reporting a bug.


0. Install the required components and libraries, i.e.:
	* OCaml (the version used to develop IMITATOR II is 3.11.2)
	* The OCaml ExtLib library (Extended Standard Library for Objective Caml)
	* The GMP library Ocaml interface (http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~monniaux/download/mlgmp.tar.gz)
	* The PPL library, including its Ocaml interface (http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/)
	* the PWL library (Parma Watchdog Library), usually part of PPL

   Optional components
	* dot (module of graphviz)

Note that 'dot', used to generate graphical outputs, is not necessary
if you run IMITATOR using the '-no-dot' option.

The above libraries will probably require themselves several other
libraries, including:
	* g++
	* m4
	* GMP
	* Camlidl
	* sed
	* MPFR

1. Extract the files from the archive to an installation directory,
   say <IMITATOR_install_dir>.

2. Open the Makefile and update:
	* EXTLIB_PATH : path to Ocaml ExtLib
	* OCAML_PPL_PATH : path to the PPL Ocaml interface files
	* OCAML_GMP_PATH : path to the GMP Ocaml interface files
	* CLIB_PATH : path to the required native C libs, including:
	  libpwl, libgmpxx, libgmp, libppl


If you installed the required libraries in directories that are not
searched by default by the compiler and/or linking tools, then, like
with other libraries, you may need to set up some environment
variables such as C_INCLUDE_PATH (to find headers), LIBRARY_PATH (to
find libraries); this list is not exhaustive and some environment
variables may be specific to your system.

3. Type "make all".

IMITATOR will be installed in the installation directory <IMITATOR_install_dir>/bin.
You may wish copy it to your default binary directory by typing, e.g.:
"sudo cp <IMITATOR_install_dir>/bin/IMITATOR /usr/bin/".
