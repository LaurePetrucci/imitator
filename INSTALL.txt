                        Installing IMITATOR II
                        ======================



Note: In case of problem, please read this INSTALL file carefully before reporting a bug.


0. Install the required components and libraries, i.e.:
	* OCaml (the version used to develop IMITATOR II is 3.11.2)
	* The APRON numerical abstract domain library, and its interface with OCaml
	* The OCaml ExtLib library (Extended Standard Library for Objective Caml)
	* dot (module of graphviz)

Note that 'dot', used to generate graphical outputs, is not necessary if you run IMITATOR II using the '-no-dot' option.

The above libraries will probably require themselves several other libraries, including:
	* g++
	* m4
	* GMP
	* Camlidl
	* sed
	* MPFR

1. Extract the files from the archive to an installation directory, say <IMITATOR_II_install_dir>.

2. Open the Makefile and update:
	* OCAMLIB_PATH
	* APRON_PATH

If you installed the required libraries in directories that are not searched by default by the compiler and/or linking tools, then, like with other libraries, you may need to set up some environment variables such as C_INCLUDE_PATH (to find headers), LIBRARY_PATH (to find libraries), and if the shared library has been installed, LD_LIBRARY_PATH (before execution) or LD_RUN_PATH (before linking); this list is not exhaustive and some environment variables may be specific to your system.

3. Type "make all".

IMITATOR II will be installed in the installation directory <IMITATOR_II_install_dir>.
You may copy it to your default binary directory by typing, e.g.:
	"sudo cp <IMITATOR_II_install_dir>/IMITATOR /usr/bin/".
