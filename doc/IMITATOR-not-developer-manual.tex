\chapter{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\imitator{}~\cite{AFKS12} has no developer manual, for many (mainly bad) reasons:
lack of time, small team of developers with strong interactions, little concurrent development.

Nevertheless, this document tries (or will try) to summarize some of the important internal characteristics of \imitator{}.
It will naturally evolve with time.

\chapter{Constraint Representation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Constraints are implemented using the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)~\cite{bhz08}.
Constraints in PPL use integer-valued indexes for variables.

In \imitator{}, the variables are numbered as follows in the constraint, starting from~0:
\begin{itemize}
	\item first the parameters
	\item then the regular clocks in the model
	\item then the observer clock (if any), automatically inferred from the property (if any)
	\item then the extra reset clock (mainly used to measure time elapsing in non-Zeno checking)
	\item then all discrete variables.
\end{itemize}
