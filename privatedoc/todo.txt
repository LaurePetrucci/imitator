BUGS
************************************************************
[!] graphical cartography seems not to work when called with more than 2 parameters
	example: flipflop.imi (with all parameters) and flipflop.v0
	it works well with 2 parameters only

[!] NumConst was not tested (and, indeed, numconst_of_string does not work) for negative numbers !!!

[!] NumConst.numconst_of_float does not give the specified result! (it is used in Pi0Parser)
